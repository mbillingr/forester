# Forester Examples

To run the examples:

1. clone the repository
2. change to `forester/forester-examples`
3. run `cargo run --release --example <example-name>` (make sure to use relase mode!)

Some of the examples produce output in the terminal, while others crate a `.png` image 
in the working directory or open a gnuplot window.
